Welcome to kmerExtractor's documentation!
=========================================

A genome sequence is composed of four basic types of nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
All possible nucleotide substrings of length $k$ are called **k-mers**. For example, for $k=2$ there are $4^k=4^2=16$ different 2-mers corresponding to: AA, AC, AG, AT, CA, CC, CG, CT, GA, GC, GG, GT, TA, TC, TG, TT.

The kmerExtractor software calculates the k-mer frequencies for windows within the chromosomes of an organism's sequence.
It takes as input a FASTA file with the nucleotide sequence of an organism separated by chromosomes. The software splits the chromosomes into windows of the size specified by the user. For a given $k$, the kmerExtractor computes the frequency of the k-mers in the different windows within the chromosomes. It returns a csv file indicating the chromosome, the window index, the start and end position of the window, and the frequencies of the corresponding k-mers.
